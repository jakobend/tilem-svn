TilEmQt : a GUI frontend to TilEm core library

It is written in C++ using the Qt4 toolkit and released under GNU GPL3.

1) Building

	* get all dependencies, namely Qt4 and tilem (and obviously their dependencies as well)
	optionnally you may want to get libticalcs2/libticables/libtifiles (all of which are TILP
	dependencies) to enable link emulation.
	
	* run the following command in a shell (in the appropriate directory) :
	
		qmake && make
		
	or, to build with link emulation :
	
		qmake -config enable_link && make
		
2) Using
	
	To use the emulator you will need a ROM file. Note that the ROM file need not contain a
	valid OS : TilEm supports OS-less ROMs and (if build with linking emulation) is able to
	load the OS of your choice into such a "blank" ROM.
	
	The emulator window will show up as a calculator image. All buttons are clickable and most
	keypresses can also be triggered through the keyboard.
	
	At anytime you have the possibility to save the emulator state (ROM/RAM/regs/...) into a file
	(note that it may alter the source ROM) and to switch to a different ROM.
	
	tilem supports z80-based TI calculators from the 73 to the 86 but some skins are lacking
	at the moment so it is not recommended to try to load 76/81/82/85/86 ROMS at the moment.
	
3) Extending

	There are two main ways to extend TilEmQt and both are useful and welcome :
	
	* creating new skins (for not yet supported clacs or with better resolution for instance)
	-> no programming knowledge required
	
	* hacking the source code to add new features and/or fix bugs
	-> requires C/C++ knowledge and some familiarity with either Qt or tilem/ticalcs/ticables
	libs.
