TilEmQt : a GUI frontend to TilEm core library

It is written in C++ using the Qt4 toolkit and released under GNU GPL3.

1) Building

	* get all dependencies, namely Qt4 and tilem (and obviously their dependencies as well)
	optionnally you may want to get libticalcs2/libticables/libtifiles (all of which are TILP
	dependencies) to enable link emulation.
	
	* run the following command in a shell (in the appropriate directory) :
	
		qmake && make
		
	or, to build with link emulation :
	
		qmake -config enable_link && make
		
2) Using
	
	To use the emulator you will need a ROM file. Note that the ROM file need not contain a
	valid OS : TilEm supports OS-less ROMs and (if build with linking emulation) is able to
	load the OS of your choice into such a "blank" ROM.
	
	The emulator window will show up as a calculator image. All buttons are clickable and most
	keypresses can also be triggered through the keyboard.
	
	At anytime you have the possibility to save the emulator state (ROM/RAM/regs/...) into a file
	(note that it may alter the source ROM) and to switch to a different ROM.
	
	tilem supports z80-based TI calculators from the 73 to the 86 but some skins are lacking
	at the moment so it is not recommended to try to load 76/81/82/85/86 ROMS at the moment.
	
3) Linking
	
	TilEm has three mode of linking, all of which depend on the availability of libticables,
	libticalcs and libtifiles.
	
	* internal "drag2calc" : drag and drop files to send them to any emulated calculator.
	* internal "calc2calc" : create a connection between two emulated calcs and let them
	communicate as they see fit
	* external : open a "TIEMU cable" (libticables terminology) making it possible for
	other programs using libticables (most notably TiLP) to communicate with an emulated
	calc.
	
	The drag2calc mode is always active (provided link support was enabled at compile time)
	but the other two modes have to be enabled manually.
	
	All linking mode are mutually exclusive : an emulated calc cannot respond to stimuli from
	more than one linking mode at the same time. However it is possible to have multiple
	calc2calc connections and drag2calc operations running at the same time as long as each
	calc is only involved in one at the same time.
	
	The external connection is even more restricted (due to internal libticables limitaiton)
	in that there can only one connection at a time (systemwide).
	
4) Debugging
	
	WIP
	
5) Extending

	There are two main ways to extend TilEmQt and both are useful and welcome :
	
	* creating new skins (for not yet supported clacs or with better resolution for instance)
	-> no programming knowledge required
	
	* hacking the source code to add new features and/or fix bugs
	-> requires C/C++ knowledge and some familiarity with either Qt or tilem/ticalcs/ticables
	libs.
