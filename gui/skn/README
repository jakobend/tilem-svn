** About the format : **

When I started to work on tilem 2, I decided firstly to use the old tilem format (4 pixs around a lcd).
But that's not a good idea, and the new skin creation is so hard like this ... :(

Finally, we (with Benjamin) have choosen the Tiemu skin format:
This format consists in a binary file containing skin information (author, name, model, size etc...) and in the second part :the image data.
With this format, it becomes really simple and fun to create a skin.
Tiemu Skinedit works perfectly for tilem 2 (how do you think I 've created these "officials skins :P).
I hope this new format will pleased to you.

Thank you Julien Blache for his help and his authorization to use Tiemu skin format and skinops.c/skinops.h.
Thank you Romain Lievin too.



** About the image source : **

To find free files to generate skins is not so easy :|
A part was found on wikimedia (god bless wikimedia)
For the others, it seems there's no one to revendicate.
(I'm just waiting for an eventually DCMA notice lol)

For the source of the pictures :
ti73.skn = no author (seems to be public domain or free) 
ti81.skn = GFDL wikimedia.commons
ti82.skn = GFDL wikimedia.commons
TI82stats.skn = GFDL wikimedia.commons
ti83.skn = My TI83 !!!
ti83plus.skn = no author (modified with The gimp)
ti84plus.skn = no author (modified with The gimp)
