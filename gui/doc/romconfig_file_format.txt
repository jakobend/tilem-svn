TilEm v2.xx romconfig format
               ********************************

Firstly : THIS FILE AND THIS FORMAT ARE INSPIRED FROM THE WORK OF JULIEN BLACHE AND ROMAIN LIEVIN. THANKS TO THEM !!

I. Summary
**********

This file is used by tilem 2 to determine which core is associated to a rom.
If you don't use this file, you will be asked to say _each start up_ what's the model of the rom (or let tilem guess for you each time).

In fact, that's just save you choice :
If the rom is saved into this file, tilem launch automatically the core associated, and do not ask to you the model.
If you made a mistake and give a wrong model for a rom, simply erase the romconfig.dat (it will be created the next start of tilem 2)


  This consists of 3 types of data :
   - strings (S)
   - integers (I)
   - char (C)

  Here's how the file is decomposed (address in hex) :

  0x000 - 0x00F (S) (16 bytes): "TilEm v2.00" (NULL-padded)
        This is the "magic number" used to be sure it's designed for tilem 2. 
  0x010 - 0x013 (I) (4 bytes) : endianness flag
        This integer is used to determine whether the file was
        produced on a machine using the same endianness as the host
        we're running on.
        When writing the file, this integer has the value 0xFEEDBABE ;
        when reading the file, if the value does not match 0xFEEDBABE,
        then you need to byteswap all the 32-bits integers.
(1)0x014 - 0x017 (I) (4 bytes) : rom name length
        Length of the following string.
(2)0x018 - 0x**** (S) (?? bytes) : 
	Name of the rom.
(3)0x*** - 0x**** (C) (1 bytes) : model id
        A char used by tilem to determine wich model is associated to this rom.

  0x*** - 0x*** : (1) (2) (3)  
	Repeats (1) (2) (3) 59 times (60 times if you count the first).
