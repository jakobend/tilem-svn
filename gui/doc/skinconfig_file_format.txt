I. Summary
**********


This file is used by tilem 2 to determine which skin is choosed (by the user) to be associated to a rom (USER CHOICE only).
If you don't use this file, the default skin wil be loaded automatically. 

If you emulate a TI82stats, maybe you will prefer the (official or not) ti82stats.skn skin.
If you save it into tilem 2, this skin will be loaded systematically with this rom, but you can change as you want (no limitation).

If you don't use this save file, you must load ti82stats skin at each start...

You can share (with another tilem user) or maybe erase skinconfig.dat (and lost user prefs) -> it will be created automatically.
 

  This consists of 3 types of data :
   - strings (S)
   - integers (I)
   - char (C)

  Here's how the file is decomposed (address in hex) :

  0x000 - 0x00F (S) (16 bytes): "TilEm v2.00" (NULL-padded)
        This is the "magic number" used to be sure it's designed for tilem 2. 
  0x010 - 0x013 (I) (4 bytes) : endianness flag
        This integer is used to determine whether the file was
        produced on a machine using the same endianness as the host
        we're running on.
        When writing the file, this integer has the value 0xFEEDBABE ;
        when reading the file, if the value does not match 0xFEEDBABE,
        then you need to byteswap all the 32-bits integers.
(1)0x014 - 0x017 (I) (4 bytes) : rom name length
        Length of the following string.
(2)0x018 - 0x**** (S) (?? bytes) : 
	Name of the rom.
(3)0x014 - 0x017 (I) (4 bytes) : Skin name length
	Length of the following string.
(4)0x*** - 0x**** (S) (?? bytes) : model id
        Name of the skin to use.

  0x*** - 0x*** : (1) (2) (3) (4) 
	Repeats (1) (2) (3) 59 times (60 times if you count the first).
